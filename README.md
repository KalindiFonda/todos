# to do counter

As I near a 10 year anniversary of an element on my to do list, I want to celebrate this, with a (series of) project(s) related to to do lists.


I'll start with the counter.
Over the last few days, I've been collecting all the todos from my head, from random papers, from various documents, and I am just putting them on a mega list.
At the end of the day, I do the count of aditions, and the count of completed to dos, and eventually retired ones as well. They go from buy avokados, to write xx email to get financially independent.
So span is pretty varied.

For now no info on creation date, of estimated time of done, or estimated duration time, or or or.
Just a + 1 or a - 1.


Imagining it would be fun to do a graph as well.

So:
DISPLAY:
- current number of active TO DOs
- daily added
- daily removed
---- graph of ^DIS

- ability to select date

FUNCTIONALITY:
- store number of current active TO DOs
- input
	- new
	- completed
	- retired


FUTURE:
- have listed todos:
	- characteristics
		- initialized date
		- estimated duration
		- estimated completion date
		- completed date (can have, can not have)


	- interesting things:
		- difference completion/estimate
		- duration initial date/completion date

- waiting days
